## Illinois State Employee Pay Analysis

## Introduction
#### We will be having a look today at the Illinois government's employees data. We will analyse the Illinois government's different agencies, their employees annual salaries and many other interesting stuff from 2011. So lets dive into it.

#### Before diving into more details, I though it will be better if we could start by just analysing the average salaries the employees received between 2011 to 2021. As we can see that, overall it was a general increasing trend since 2011 to 2020. However, we can see that there was a dip in 2021. This may be due to the pandemic that affected the entire world.

#### We will now move forward and dive deeper to understand more about the dataset.

#### The dashboard consists of a heat map and a pie chart. It is an interactive dashboard
#### So before we begin, what is a heat map?
#### It is nothing but a chart which has small small squares inside it. The colour of the squares indicate how small or how large the value is. As we can see below, dark red values are smaller values and dark green values are bigger values.
#### So now that we understood what a heat map is, we can now have a look at the below dashboard. The heatmap in the dashboard consists of "Years" on the x-axis and "Agency" on the y-axis. Every value inside the heatmap represents mean of the annual salaries of all the employees in a particular Agency in that particular year. For example, if we click on the agency "State Police" in the year "2016", we can see that the mean gross annual salary for all the police personnal was 56,875.17 USD. Similarly we can click on other areas in the heat map to get the average salaries of all the employees in an agency and in a particular year.
#### Now coming to the other plot inside the dashboard i.e. the Pie plot. It is interactive and changes when you click on those tiny squares inside the heatmap.
#### The Pie plot first tells us how many employees were employed in each agency. So when we click on each of the tiny square inside the heatmap, we select a particular year, for example when we selected the state police in 2016, we can see the number of employees across all the agencies in "2016". Isn't that cool?
#### So to sum it all up, the Heatmap gives us the average salaries of all the employees in a particular agency and in a particular year. The Pie plot gives us the number of employees across all the agencies in the year selected in the Heatmap.
#### NOTE: To experiene and play around with the interactivity, please download the Sarthak_Bhingarde_Project_Part3.ipynb and Restart and Run all cells.
