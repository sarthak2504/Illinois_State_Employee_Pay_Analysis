## Illinois State Employee Pay Analysis

## Introduction
#### We will be having a look today at the Illinois government's employees data. We will analyse the Illinois government's different agencies, their employees annual salaries and many other interesting stuff from 2011. So lets dive into it.

#### Before diving into more details, I though it will be better if we could start by just analysing the average salaries the employees received between 2011 to 2021. As we can see that, overall it was a general increasing trend since 2011 to 2020. However, we can see that there was a dip in 2021. This may be due to the pandemic that affected the entire world.

#### We will now move forward and dive deeper to understand more about the dataset.

#### The dashboard consists of a heat map and a pie chart. It is an interactive dashboard
#### So before we begin, what is a heat map?
#### It is nothing but a chart which has small small squares inside it. The colour of the squares indicate how small or how large the value is. As we can see below, dark red values are smaller values and dark green values are bigger values.
#### So now that we understood what a heat map is, we can now have a look at the below dashboard. The heatmap in the dashboard consists of "Years" on the x-axis and "Agency" on the y-axis. Every value inside the heatmap represents mean of the annual salaries of all the employees in a particular Agency in that particular year. For example, if we click on the agency "State Police" in the year "2016", we can see that the mean gross annual salary for all the police personnal was 56,875.17 USD. Similarly we can click on other areas in the heat map to get the average salaries of all the employees in an agency and in a particular year.
#### Now coming to the other plot inside the dashboard i.e. the Pie plot. It is interactive and changes when you click on those tiny squares inside the heatmap.
#### The Pie plot first tells us how many employees were employed in each agency. So when we click on each of the tiny square inside the heatmap, we select a particular year, for example when we selected the state police in 2016, we can see the number of employees across all the agencies in "2016". Isn't that cool?
#### So to sum it all up, the Heatmap gives us the average salaries of all the employees in a particular agency and in a particular year. The Pie plot gives us the number of employees across all the agencies in the year selected in the Heatmap.
#### NOTE: To experiene and play around with the interactivity, please download the Sarthak_Bhingarde_Project_Part3.ipynb and Restart and Run all cells.

#### Now comes another dataset, since I selected the State Police earlier, lets have a look at a contextual dataset of Illinois State Police.

#### This is a horizontal bar chart of the average salaries across different police titles in the state of Illinois.
#### As we can see below, there are so many different titles existing inside the police department. Here, each bar represents the actual salaries that are being paid to these police personnel. If we look closely, we can see that there are two major titles that stand out, "Suerintendent Highway Police" and "Asst Deputy Director (Sworn)" that receive the maximum salary among all the other titles. We can also see that lowest salaries are received by "Trainee's".
#### The following bar chart helps us get a deeper understanding into salaries received by different police personnel titles

#### Here we are having a look at bilingual requirements and their data in the Illinois government. The Illinois government conducts an annual assessment of all agencies regarding their need for employees with bilingual capabilities to serve significant numbers of non-English speaking or culturally distinct persons.
#### The following image indicates the bilingual interactions conducted by each agency in the state of Illinois

#### The following image indicates the bilingual jobs in the state of Illinois

#### The following chart indicates the number of employees by language who are receiving bilingual pay.

#### Now we will have a look at another contextual dataset which highlights the salaries received by employees of the New York State Authorities.

#### The following horizontal bar chart helps us to understand the salaries received by different state authorities in the New York State.
#### We can see that Nassau County has the highest average salary which is approximately 140,000 USD. 
#### This dataset mainly illustrates the salaries received by different state authorities in the state of new york. This helps us to know how the state authorities in New York are paid, what is their salary range as compare to the state of Illinois.

#### Hence, to sum it all up we have analysed the Illinois state employee pay dataset and have identified the average salary from 2011 to 2021. We also played around with an interactive dashboard consisting of a Heatmap and a Pie plot identifying the average pay across agencies and number of employees in each agency.
#### We then moved to contextual datasets with the Illinois state police dataset for 2019 and saw their salary distribution across different titles in their department.
#### We then looked at bilingual needs of the government by identifying job opportunities and pay received by individuals across agencies in the Illinoi government. Finally we saw New York state authorities pay across multiple authorities in the state of New York giving us a comparison between pay received by state authorities and government agencies in Illinois.
