## Illinois State Employee Pay Analysis

## Introduction
#### We will be having a look today at the Illinois government's employees data. We will analyse the Illinois government's different agencies, their employees annual salaries and many other interesting stuff from 2011. So lets dive into it.

### Before diving into more details, I though it will be better if we could start by just analysing the average salaries the employees received between 2011 to 2021. As we can see that, overall it was a general increasing trend since 2011 to 2020. However, we can see that there was a dip in 2021. This may be due to the pandemic that affected the entire world.
